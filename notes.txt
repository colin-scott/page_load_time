-------------- Notes: --------------

It's the `requests` table that includes responses headers, not the `pages`
table.

The `stats` (and `pages`?) table has the original onLoad time.

Don't necessarily need to know the critical path, just need to know what the
PLT is after setting network latency for cacheable objects to 0.

-------------- Questions: --------------

What's the query to know whether a response is cacheable?

Do we have an estimate on what cache hit ratio prefetch/preconnect achieve in
practice? Obviously not 100%, as we're assuming for the analysis.

Does WPR support HAR?

Are the HTTP Archives complete enough to be able to replay with WPR?

-------------- Implementation notes: --------------

- Might need to get webkit-headless running. (Although, it was IE that did the
  original web page loads?)

- It is possible to get individual HAR files, by issuing queries to:

http://httparchive.webpagetest.org/export.php?test=$wptid&run=$wptrun&bodies=0&pretty=0

using the wptid and wptrun values in the Pages table

- Need to join the `time` field of the original request with the `time` field of
the responses.
