-------------- Notes: --------------

It's the `requests` table that includes responses headers, not the `pages`
table.

The `stats` (and `pages`?) table has the original onLoad time.

Don't necessarily need to know the critical path, just need to know what the
PLT is after setting network latency for cacheable objects to 0.

-------------- Questions: --------------

Does WPR insert the original delays by default? -> Yes, but the original
execution isn't that close to the replayed. Although, when repeatedly
replaying, the results are fairly consistent. Plan: get the original PLT by
replaying, not by mining it directly from the HAR. This also solves the IE
prolem.

Does HAR have enough of the response body content to be able to replay?

Do we have an estimate on what cache hit ratio prefetch/preconnect achieve in
practice? Obviously not 100%, as we're assuming for the analysis.

Are the HTTP Archives complete enough to be able to replay with WPR? Email
response said something about javascript injection (deterministic.js).

-------------- Implementation notes: --------------

- Might need to get webkit-headless running. (Although, it was IE that did the
  original web page loads?)

There's also WPT.

- It is possible to get individual HAR files, by issuing queries to:

http://httparchive.webpagetest.org/export.php?test=$wptid&run=$wptrun&bodies=1&pretty=0

using the wptid and wptrun values in the Pages table

- Need to join the `time` field of the original request with the `time` field of
the responses to get the relative timings.
